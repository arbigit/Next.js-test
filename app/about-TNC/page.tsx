                Changing how you think will change who you are. <i>Literally.</i> You will <u>evolve at the biochemical and energetic levels.</u>
              </p>
              <p>
                The difference between who I am now and who I was as a drinker is consciousness. I am aware of myself and of my options. I&apos;ve always believed in autonomy and liberation. I just didn&apos;t know that <i>my own brain</i> was the primary source of my oppression.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl">
                It feels super badass <i>to think</i> that you live by your own rules.<br />
                But you don&apos;t.
              </p>
              <p>
                Struggling for control is <i>proof</i> you&apos;re not really in control. Trying to use the 5 percent of your brain that is conscious to override the 95 percent that is subconscious is exhausting.
              </p>
              <p>
                My function as your coach will be to teach you how to identify the hidden rules that are holding you hostage.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because <i>that&apos;s</i> the only way to break them.
              </p>
